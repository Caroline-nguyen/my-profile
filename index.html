				<p> 
			I am a second year student at IESEG School of management and I just started to learn how to create my own web page ! I am a person 	passionate about discovering new things and learning new skills. In general, I am quite self-taught and I like to go at my own pace.

			<h2> Video games üéÆ </h2>
				<p> I have been introduced to video games since my young age, which made me become a gamer. What I like about games is that it works on your accuracy, reflexes, concentration... There are a lot of prejudices about video games even though they have a lot of benefits. I also started to stream, you'll find it by clicking below. </p>

			<h2> Drawing ‚úèÔ∏è </h2>
				<p> Drawing is one of my hobbies. I draw when I have inspiration. I need a model to have a basis for drawing. One of my regrets is that I didn't draw often when I was younger, to get the hang of it. One of my last drawings with a graphic tablet is the following:  </p>

		<h2> In Seoul, in March 2023 </h2>
			<p> Thanks to my school, I'll be an exchange student at Konkuk University in Seoul, South Korea. Since I was young, I have always been interested in South Korea culture, music, food... Traveling in South Korea was one of my dream, which will be realized next year. </p>
